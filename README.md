# SafeToSwim
A service that tracks harmful algal blooms (HAB).

## Getting started
### To run the service...
1. Start the server: Run flask_server.py from the 'servers' directory
2. Call the service: 
   1. In a browser go to localhost:5000/predict
   2. Or call post.bat in the 'clients' directory   
## Roadmap
1) Identify algae blooms
   1. In Lake Champlain from user-uploaded images.
   2. From images uploaded by other users
2) Serve data about presence of HABs through server API
